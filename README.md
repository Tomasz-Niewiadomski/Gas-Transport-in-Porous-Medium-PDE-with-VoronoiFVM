Solving the Gas Transport in Porous Medium PDE ðŸ§½ - using the Voronoi Finite Volume Method (VoronoiFVM.jl package)

Simulation results for 1 and 2 dimensions, based on the Barenblatt solution's initial condition.
Comparison with DifferentialEquations.jl solver yealding a marginally better result.
Successful error convergence in both cases - using Implicit & Explicit Euler method.
